<h1>Demo: Advanced Features</h1>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Callbacks:</strong> The directives offer various callbacks, which in this example will log the events to the console.
        Additionally, the callbacks on the dnd-list can prevent an element from being dropped. In this example you can't drop elements
        in the first list position, because we are preventing that in the dnd-dragover callback.</li>
    <li><strong>dnd-allowed-types in nested lists:</strong> We are using the dnd-allowed-types attribute to ensure that Containers
        only accept items, but not other containers.</li>
    <li><strong>dnd-horizontal-list:</strong> This attribute tells the positioning algorithm to drop incoming elements left or right
        of the existing elements, instead of above or below.</li>
    <li><strong>dnd-external-sources:</strong> Allows to drag and drop elements accross browser windows, which you can test in this
        example. The downside to this is that the lists will accept arbitrary text to be dropped. To prevent that, the dnd-drop callback
        verifies that the dropped element is of the desired format.</li>
    <li><strong>dnd-effect-allowed:</strong> This attribute is set to 'copyMove' in this example, which means that the user can choose
        whether to copy or move an element by holding down the Ctrl key. Note that this doesn't work in Chrome very well.</li>
    <li><strong>dnd-handle:</strong> Dragging can be restricted to only start on specific elements inside the draggable element.
      In this example, the container items can only be dragged from their title bar.</li>

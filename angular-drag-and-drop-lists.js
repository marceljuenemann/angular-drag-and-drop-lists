  /**
   * Use the dnd-draggable attribute to make your element draggable
   *
   * Attributes:
   * - dnd-draggable                 Required attribute. The value has to be an object that represents the data
   *                                 of the element. In case of a drag and drop operation the object will be
   *                                 serialized and unserialized on the receiving end.
   * - dnd-selected                  Callback that is invoked when the element was clicked but not dragged.
   *                                 The original click event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-effect-allowed            Use this attribute to limit the operations that can be performed. Options:
   *                                 - "move": The drag operation will move the element. This is the default.
   *                                 - "copy": The drag operation will copy the element. Shows a copy cursor.
   *                                 - "copyMove": The user can choose between copy and move by pressing the
   *                                   ctrl or shift key. *Not supported in IE:* In Internet Explorer this
   *                                   option will be the same as "copy". *Not fully supported in Chrome on
   *                                   Windows:* In the Windows version of Chrome the cursor will always be the
   *                                   move cursor. However, when the user drops an element and has the ctrl
   *                                   key pressed, we will perform a copy anyways.
   *                                 - HTML5 also specifies the "link" option, but this library does not
   *                                   actively support it yet, so use it at your own risk.
   * - dnd-moved                     Callback that is invoked when the element was moved. Usually you will
   *                                 remove your element from the original list in this callback, since the
   *                                 directive is not doing that for you automatically. The original dragend
   *                                 event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-canceled                  Callback that is invoked if the element was dragged, but the operation was
   *                                 canceled and the element was not dropped. The original dragend event will
   *                                 be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-copied                    Same as dnd-moved, just that it is called when the element was copied
   *                                 instead of moved. The original dragend event will be provided in the local
   *                                 event variable.
   * - dnd-dragstart                 Callback that is invoked when the element was dragged. The original
   *                                 dragstart event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-dragend                   Callback that is invoked when the drag operation ended. Available local
   *                                 variables are event and dropEffect.
   * - dnd-type                      Use this attribute if you have different kinds of items in your
   *                                 application and you want to limit which items can be dropped into which
   *                                 lists. Combine with dnd-allowed-types on the dnd-list(s). This attribute
   *                                 must be a lower case string. Upper case characters can be used, but will
   *                                 be converted to lower case automatically.
   * - dnd-disable-if                You can use this attribute to dynamically disable the draggability of the
   *                                 element. This is useful if you have certain list items that you don't want
   *                                 to be draggable, or if you want to disable drag & drop completely without
   *                                 having two different code branches (e.g. only allow for admins).
   * - dnd-dynamic-placeholder-size  You can use this attribute to decide if the placeholder generated during drag
   *                                 has a dynamic height, i.e. Height of the element being dragged or a fixed height.
   *
   * CSS classes:
   * - dndDragging        This class will be added to the element while the element is being
   *                      dragged. It will affect both the element you see while dragging and the
   *                      source element that stays at it's position. Do not try to hide the source
   *                      element with this class, because that will abort the drag operation.
   * - dndDraggingSource  This class will be added to the element after the drag operation was
   *                      started, meaning it only affects the original element that is still at
   *                      it's source position, and not the "element" that the user is dragging with
   *                      his mouse pointer.

   * dnd-draggable directive to your li element(s).
   *
   * Attributes:
   * - dnd-list             Required attribute. The value has to be the array in which the data of
   *                        the dropped element should be inserted. The value can be blank if used
   *                        with a custom dnd-drop handler that always returns true.
   * - dnd-allowed-types    Optional array of allowed item types. When used, only items that had a
   *                        matching dnd-type attribute will be dropable. Upper case characters will
   *                        automatically be converted to lower case.
   * - dnd-disable-if       Optional boolean expresssion. When it evaluates to true, no dropping
   *                        into the list is possible. Note that this also disables rearranging
   *                        items inside the list.
   * - dnd-horizontal-list  Optional boolean expresssion. When it evaluates to true, the positioning
   *                        algorithm will use the left and right halfs of the list items instead of
   *                        the upper and lower halfs.
   * - dnd-dragover         Optional expression that is invoked when an element is dragged over the
   *                        list. If the expression is set, but does not return true, the element is
   *                        not allowed to be dropped. The following variables will be available:
   *                        - event: The original dragover event sent by the browser.
   *                        - index: The position in the list at which the element would be dropped.
   *                        - type: The dnd-type set on the dnd-draggable, or undefined if non was
   *                          set. Will be null for drops from external sources in IE and Edge,
   *                          since we don't know the type in those cases.
   *                        - external: Whether the element was dragged from an external source.
   * - dnd-drop             Optional expression that is invoked when an element is dropped on the
   *                        list. The same variables as for dnd-dragover will be available, with the
   *                        exception that type is always known and therefore never null. There
   *                        will also be an item variable, which is the transferred object. The
   *                        return value determines the further handling of the drop:
   *                        - falsy: The drop will be canceled and the element won't be inserted.
   *                        - true: Signalises that the drop is allowed, but the dnd-drop
   *                          callback already took care of inserting the element.
   *                        - otherwise: All other return values will be treated as the object to
   *                          insert into the array. In most cases you want to simply return the
   *                          item parameter, but there are no restrictions on what you can return.
   * - dnd-inserted         Optional expression that is invoked after a drop if the element was
   *                        actually inserted into the list. The same local variables as for
   *                        dnd-drop will be available. Note that for reorderings inside the same
   *                        list the old element will still be in the list due to the fact that
   *                        dnd-moved was not called yet.
   * - dnd-external-sources Optional boolean expression. When it evaluates to true, the list accepts
   *                        drops from sources outside of the current browser tab. This allows to
   *                        drag and drop accross different browser tabs. The only major browser
   *                        that does not support this is currently Microsoft Edge.
   *
   * CSS classes:
   * - dndPlaceholder       When an element is dragged over the list, a new placeholder child
   *                        element will be added. This element is of type li and has the class
   *                        dndPlaceholder set. Alternatively, you can define your own placeholder
   *                        by creating a child element with dndPlaceholder class.
   * - dndDragover          Will be added to the list while an element is dragged over the list.

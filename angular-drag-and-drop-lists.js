    /**
     * Use the dnd-draggable attribute to make your element draggable
     *
     * Attributes:
     * - dnd-draggable      Required attribute. The value has to be an object that represents the data
     *                      of the element. In case of a drag and drop operation the object will be
     *                      serialized and unserialized on the receiving end.
     * - dnd-droppable-in   Required attribute. Selector to filter drop zone.
     * - dnd-selected       Callback that is invoked when the element was clicked but not dragged
     * - dnd-effect-allowed Use this attribute to limit the operations that can be performed. Options are:
     *                      - "move": The drag operation will move the element. This is the default
     *                      - "copy": The drag operation will copy the element. There will be a copy cursor.
     *                      - "copyMove": The user can choose between copy and move by pressing the ctrl
     *                        or shift key. *Not supported in IE:* In Internet Explorer this option
     *                        will be the same as "copy". *Not fully supported in Chrome on Windows:*
     *                        In the Windows version of Chrome the cursor will always be the move cursor.
     *                        However, when the user drops an element and has the ctrl key pressed, we
     *                        will perform a copy anyways.
     *                      - HTML5 also specifies the "link" option, but this library does not actively
     *                        support it yet, so use it at your own risk.
     * - dnd-moved          Callback that is invoked when the element was moved. Usually you will remove
     *                      your element from the original list in this callback, since the directive
     *                      is not doing that for you automatically.
     * - dnd-copied         Same as dnd-moved, just that it is called when the element was copied
     *                      instead of moved.
     *
     * CSS classes:
     * - dndDragging        This class will be added to the element while the element is being dragged.
     *                      It will affect both the element you see while dragging and the source
     *                      element that stays at it's position. Do not try to hide the source element
     *                      with this class, because that will abort the drag operation.
     * - dndDraggingSource  This class will be added to the element after the drag operation was started,
     *                      meaning it only affects the original element that is still at it's source
     *                      position, and not the "element" that the user is dragging with his mouse pointer.
     * - dndDropZone        This class will be added to elements able to accept current dragged element.
